# 2021 Update
Unfortunately the app is not maintained anymore. I was sick of dealing with Apple's weird demands and focused on other projects. PRs are welcome from anyone that wants to contribute. 

# kif - keyboard

I'm sick of random companies watching every word I type. So I created this simple custom keyboard for my personal use. I'm adding features as I go along. It doesn't need any internet connectivity for the full feature set. 

What's supported:
1. basic layout
2. in memory word level autocomplete and spellcheck with word probabilities 
3. double space inserts dot
4. some special characters
5. some emoji's
6. optimal key button hitboxes. (Same as IOS keyboard. This one uses larger hitboxes than the actual keyboard buttons for faster typing)
7. Interchangeable prediction row for showing special characters/emoji
8. Long press buttons for secondary character
9. Press and slide out for secondary character (allows very fast typing)
10. Long press delete button allows fast delete like IOS keyboard 
11. Support for Turkish lang and characters
12. Support for Dvorak layout
13. Support for Chinese (pinyin)
14. Next word prediction (English only)
15. Caps-lock 
16. Dark theme
